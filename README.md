# Document Image Enhancer

## Project Description
The Document Image Enhancer is a sophisticated web-based application designed to optimize and manage document images efficiently. Utilizing Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), the system offers advanced features like deblurring, binarizing, and watermark removal to enhance the quality of document images. Additionally, users can extract text from the enhanced documents using Tesseract OCR, with the extracted data being securely encrypted using the Caesar Cipher technique. The application also includes functionality for applying various image filters, such as changing the color scale, and provides integrated mailing services to facilitate document sharing.
